We are just two normal guys who decided to go into freelance in our respective careers. We’re Barry a web designer and developer and Rob, a writer and SEO expert. Barry is a full on freelancer, taking on gigs as they come in. Rob is a bit more of an entrepreneur, exploring creative ways to make money on the internet. Everything from writing copy for all manner of clients, writing books, scripts and building communities on social media platforms.


That being said, this website covers more than just freelancing, but the growing zeitgeist of this time which is freedom from the physical shackles of work in a traditional sense. The freedom to choose where to work, to choose what to work on. to decide how much to earn in a year, the freedom to strike the balance between work and pleasure. And of course, the freedom to travel. In that sense, to us freelancing is more than what it is written on paper. It’s lifestyle choice, a state of being.


On this page we talk about what it takes to become a freelancer, overcome the hurdles, find clients, how to figure out what your time is worth and pretty much everything you need to know to become a freelancer.
